## Introduction

This Snake Game is a simple yet entertaining project that demonstrates the use of Python for creating interactive applications. It's designed to be run in a Jupyter Notebook environment, making it accessible for learners and developers interested in game development and Python programming.

## Features

- **Interactive Gameplay**: Control the snake using keyboard inputs to navigate and collect food.
- **Score Tracking**: Keep track of your score as the snake grows longer with each food item consumed.
- **Game Over Conditions**: The game ends when the snake collides with itself or the boundaries.
- **Educational Value**: Ideal for beginners to understand game loops, event handling, and basic graphics in Python.

## Installation

To run the Snake Game locally, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the Repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/DeepakSingh-7376/Snake-Game.git
   ```
2. **Navigate to the Project Directory**:
   ```bash
   cd Snake-Game
   ```
3. **Install Required Dependencies**:
   Ensure you have Python installed. Then, install the necessary packages:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```
   *Note: If `requirements.txt` is not provided, ensure you have the following packages installed:*
   ```bash
   pip install pygame
   ```
4. **Run the Jupyter Notebook**:
   ```bash
   jupyter notebook "snake game python.ipynb"
   ```

## How to Play

- **Start the Game**: Run all cells in the Jupyter Notebook to initialize the game.
- **Control the Snake**:
  - Use the **Arrow Keys** to move the snake in the desired direction.
- **Objective**:
  - Navigate the snake to collect food items.
  - Each food item collected increases the snake's length and your score.
- **Game Over**:
  - The game ends if the snake collides with itself or the game boundaries.
